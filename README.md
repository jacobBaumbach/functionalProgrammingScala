# functionalProgrammingScala

These are my solutions to the exercises from the book [Functional Programming in Scala.](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)  Each notebook is for a separate chapter.  I have included a lot of comments with my code to justify my understanding to myself.
